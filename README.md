# Singular-Value-Decomposition-of-Block-Diagonal-Matrices
If we are gien 1) a block diagonal matrix M 2) its block matrices A and B and 3) the Singular Value decomposition of M
It is generally seen that the singular values of M (returned by Python) are in non-decreasing order. However this non-decreasing
order is the result of mixing up or jumbling the singular values of the block matrices A and B. How then do we map the singular
values of M to which block matrix (A or B) it belongs to?
